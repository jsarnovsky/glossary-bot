As most users access this system every two years or so, usually users have to make a new login for every move. However, their record stays consistent and collected on the back end, despite the change in logins.
/define pro gear = items that need to be moved related to someone's work, be it the servicemember or their spouse.
/define rfi = request for information
/define ezdps = a m ddleman private company that works between military systems and TSPs. They take care of scheduling and payment. TSPs prefer this method with the current system.

/define don't-pack room = where servicemembers and families undergoing an HHG move should put fragile or expensive items they will be moving themselves, usually indicated by a closed door in their current home with a sign telling movers to stay out.

/define dd = requested/required delivery date. Used for HHGs. Usually this date is a few days before the RNLTD.
/define door-to-door move = the "ideal" move, as it means no storage is necessary. Storage is expensive and escalates the risk of both going over a servicemember's allotted budget for a move and of breaking things.
/define door to door move = the "ideal" move, as it means no storage is necessary. Storage is expensive and escalates the risk of both going over a servicemember's allotted budget for a move and of breaking things.
/define ial = International Auto Logistics, the service that moves servicemembers' cars for OCONUS moves. (CONUS moves pay mileage for moving cars but do not actually move vehicles; they have to be driven from point to point.)
/define cac = common access card, needed to access certain military systems and also to be the driver of a vehicle going onto a base. Pronounced "cack" (yep).

/define cap = cloud access point
/define gao = government accountability office
/define rom = rough order of magnitude
/define dual military move = when both spouses are in the military and are moving to a new location together. The current system does not allow this to be done easily and requires a lot of manual work to ensure the servicemembers are allotted their entire combined weight limit. A fairly common special case that causes problems for the back office as well as for the servicemembers, who often have to get reimbursement issues solved in the months following the move.
/define ato = authority to operate
/define entitlements = the weight, move location, and timeline allowed to a servicemember. This is based on rank and what caused the move, whether it's move orders, separation, or retirement.
/define dds = Defense Digital Service, another wing of the United States Digital Service (USDS). There are digital services for all military services (i.e., Air Force Digital service, etc.), but all members ultimately work for the USDS.
