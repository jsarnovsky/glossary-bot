As most users access this system every two years or so, usually users have to make a new login for every move. However, their record stays consistent and collected on the back end, despite the change in logins.

/dod-define dd = requested/required delivery date. Used for HHGs. Usually this date is a few days before the RNLTD.
/dod-define door-to-door move = the "ideal" move, as it means no storage is necessary. Storage is expensive and escalates the risk of both going over a servicemember's allotted budget for a move and of breaking things.

/dod-define cap = cloud access point
/dod-define gao = government accountability office
/dod-define rom = rough order of magnitude
/dod-define dual military move = when both spouses are in the military and are moving to a new location together.

A fairly common special case that causes problems for the back office as well as for the servicemembers, who often have to get reimbursement issues solved in the months following the move.
/dod-define ato = authority to operate
/dod-define entitlements = the weight, move location, and timeline allowed to a servicemember. This is based on rank and what caused the move, whether it's move orders, separation, or retirement.
